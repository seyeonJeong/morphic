        Building agents with LLM (large language model) as its core controller is a cool concept. Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as <a href="https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT" className="hover:underline">AutoGPT</a>, <a href="https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer" className="hover:underline">GPT-Engineer</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi" className="hover:underline">BabyAGI</a>, serve as inspiring examples.

        This research proposal introduces an Interrupt Handling System inspired by systems in computer architecture, but applied within a multi-agent graph-based framework. The focus is on efficiently managing agent behaviors and actions, particularly when unexpected interruptions occur.

          <p className="text-gray-800 ml-4">
          The system is designed to manage agents’ plans by deciding which agent should perform which action based on the current state of a graph. This is achieved using a graph format that tracks the agent’s state and action transitions, likely akin to state machines or decision trees.

          The research aims to develop methods to minimize the negative effects of interrupts within agent systems, particularly in scenarios involving complex multi-agent interactions.

          The diagram shows the flow of an agent within a graph, starting with the agent’s initial state, continuing with actions, and possibly ending the task. However, along this path, an interrupt is triggered, leading the system to temporarily pause or replan the agent’s tasks. The interrupt process appears to involve steps like state storage (saving necessary context before an interrupt), handling the interrupt, and then resuming or redirecting the agent’s actions once the interrupt is resolved

      <h3 id="research-2" className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 bg-yellow-200 inline-block">"Task Prioritization in Multi-Agent Systems using Priority Queues”</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-800 mb-6">
      In this sector of research, we focus on task prioritization and coordination in multi-agent systems using priority queues. The concept extends the scope of agent-based systems by adding a layer of intelligent prioritization to handle complex, multi-agent collaborations. In multi-agent systems, especially in frameworks like <b>AutoGen</b>, multiple agents must work in unison to perform various tasks. These tasks are often dependent on efficient coordination and synchronization between agents. Without a systematic approach to task prioritization, agents can be bogged down by conflicts, inefficient task execution, or bottlenecks. 
      </p>

      <br></br>
      <p><strong>The Problem:Task Coordination Challenges</strong></p>
      <p>When agents work together, there are several challenges that need to be addressd:</p>
      <br></br>


      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
        <li>
          <strong>Ambiguity in Task Priority</strong>
          <p className="text-gray-800 ml-4">
          Agents may have different interpretations of which tasks should be prioritized, leading to potential misalignment and inefficiencies.  
          </p>
        </li>
        <br></br>
        <li>
          <strong>Dynamic Reprioritization </strong>
          <p className="text-gray-800 ml-4">
          The system needs to adjust the task priorities dynamically as new tasks enter the system or the environment changes. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <br></br>
        <li>
          <strong>Synchronization </strong>
          <p className="text-gray-800 ml-4">
          Even when priorities are clear, the agents need a way to coordinate their efforts and ensure that higher-priority tasks are completed before lower-priority ones. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <br></br>
        <p>To address these challenges, the research proposes the use of <b>priority queues</b>, a fundamental data structure used to manage and order tasks based on their priority levels.</p>
        <br></br>

        <p><strong>The Solution: Priority Queues for Agent Task Management</strong></p>
        <br></br>
        <p>The concept of a priority queue enables agents to efficiently manage their tasks by dynamically assigning and reordering tasks based on their importance. Priority queues allow agents to add new tasks and adjust existing ones based on predefined criteria. This method ensures that tasks with the highest priority are executed first, while others wait in the queue for their turn.</p>
        
        <div className="my-8">
          <div className='flex justify-center'>
            <Image

          </div>
          <p className="text-center text-gray-700 mt-4">Figure 2. Diagram of Priority Queues</p>
      </div>
      <p>Fig. 2 illustrates this process using a tree-based priority queue structure. Here’s a breakdown of the steps involved:</p><br></br>
      <p id="steps" className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Process Steps</p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mb-6 ml-6">
          <li className="mb-4">
            <strong>Step 1:</strong> The system begins with a standard task hierarchy where each node represents a task, with its position in the tree indicating its current priority level.
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mt-2">
              <li>Tasks like "5," "7," "8," and "13" occupy various positions in the hierarchy based on their urgency or relevance.</li>
              <li>A new task ("25") is introduced, requiring the system to re-evaluate the task priority.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li className="mb-4">
            <strong>Step 2:</strong> The new task ("25") is inserted into the queue, triggering a reordering process. This reordering ensures that the highest priority tasks always rise to the top.
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mt-2">
              <li>The system checks whether the newly added task has a higher priority than the current task at the root (e.g., task "20").</li>
              <li>Based on this comparison, tasks are swapped accordingly.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li className="mb-4">
            <strong>Step 3:</strong> The priority queue adjusts the positions of the tasks. In this case, task "25" has the highest priority and moves to the top of the queue, while tasks "20," "15," "13," and others are re-ordered accordingly.
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside ml-6 mt-2">
              <li>The final step reflects the new state of the priority queue, where the task with the highest priority is now at the root of the tree.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>This dynamic task reordering ensures that agents always work on the most critical tasks first, allowing for more efficient task management in complex systems.</p><br></br>

        <p><strong>Use Case: AutoGen Multi-Agent Systems</strong></p>
        <p>This task prioritization system is especially valuable in environments like AutoGen, where multiple agents work together to achieve common goals. In such systems:</p><br></br>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Task synchronization and coordination</strong>between agents is critical, as tasks are often interdependent.
          </li>
          <li>
            By implementing <b>riority queues</b>, AutoGen systems can manage tasks in real-time, adjusting priorities as new tasks arise or existing tasks are modified.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>For example, consider a scenario where agents are tasked with processing vast amounts of data for an LLM application. As different components of the data become available, the system can prioritize which data chunks are most important to process first, ensuring that critical parts are processed in a timely manner.</p>
        <p><strong>Expceted Contributions</strong></p>
        <p>The research is expected to make significant contributions to the field of multi-agent systems by providing a robust framework for task prioritization:</p><br></br>

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6">
          <li>
            It enables <b>dynamic coordination</b> in complex environments where task priorities shift rapidly.
          </li>
          <li>
            The priority queue-based approach ensures that even in systems with a high degree of task complexity, agents can effectively manage and complete the most critical tasks.
          </li>
          <li>
            This system can be extended to various real-world applications, from managing computational resources in cloud environments to coordinating LLMs in complex generative AI tasks.
          </li>
        </ul><br></br>

        <p>This research is particularly timely, as multi-agent systems are becoming more prevalent in advanced AI systems. As such, developing efficient methods for task prioritization and coordination will be key to ensuring the scalability and effectiveness of these systems.</p><br></br>

        <p><strong>Key Paper Reference</strong></p>
        <p>The research is grounded in the work of <b>Wu, Q. et al. (2023)</b>, which discusses the AutoGen framework and its applications in LLM systems.
